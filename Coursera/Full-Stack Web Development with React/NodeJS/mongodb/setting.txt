Exercise (Instructions): Introduction to MongoDB
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will download and install MongoDB on your computer. You will then start a MongoDB server and interact with it using the Mongo REPL shell. At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

Download and Installing MongoDB
Start the server and interact with it using the Mongo REPL shell
Downloading and Installing MongoDB
Go to http://www.mongodb.org, then download and install MongoDB as per the instructions given there.
Create a folder named mongodb on your computer and create a subfolder under it named data.
Move to the mongodb folder and then start the MongoDB server by typing the following at the prompt:

mongod --dbpath=data --bind_ip 127.0.0.1


Open another command window and then type the following at the command prompt to start the mongo REPL shell:

mongo

The Mongo REPL shell will start running and give you a prompt to issue commands to the MongoDB server. At the Mongo REPL prompt, type the following commands one by one and see the resulting behavior:

db
     use conFusion
     db
     db.help()

You will now create a collection named dishes, and insert a new dish document in the collection:

db.dishes.insert({ name: "Uthappizza", description: "Test" });

Then to print out the dishes in the collection, type:

db.dishes.find().pretty();

Note the "_id" assigned to the dish.

Next, we will learn the information encoded into the ObjectId by typing the following at the prompt:

var id = new ObjectId();
     id.getTimestamp();

