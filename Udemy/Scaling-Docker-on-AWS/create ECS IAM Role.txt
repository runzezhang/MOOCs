Hi,

Here's a step by step with the new UI for creating the instance role (the first one on video):

1. Goto roles

2. Click create role

3. Make sure "AWS service" is selected as the trusted entity

4. Under the choose the service section, click EC2 from the top row (not from the list of a million services on the bottom).

5. Click the next: permissions button

6. Filter the policy for "AmazonEC2ContainerServiceForEC2Role" (same as on video basically) and then check it

7. Click next: tags (skip adding anything) and continue on-wards by clicking next: review

8. Name the role "ecsInstanceRole" (just like the video) and click the create role button

9. You should see your ecsInstanceRole now in the list of roles since you're back to where step 1 lead you (a list of roles)

As for attaching the read only S3 policy to that role it's the same exact workflow as what's shown on video.

So, things are basically the same except Amazon put the screens in a different order and has 1 extra step of needing to select EC2 at the beginning. However, that is quite different from the original video, so I'll throw up an update video soon. But for now I wanted to write it out and make sure things work for you with these steps, so let me know how it goes (awaiting your answer before I record a new video).

Here's a step by step with the new UI for creating the service role (the second one on video around 4:10):

1. Repeat the same 5 steps as the first one

2. Filter the policy for "AmazonEC2ContainerServiceRole" (same as on video basically) and then check it.

3. Click next: tags (skip adding anything) and continue on-wards by clicking next: review

4. Name the role "ecsServiceRole" (just like the video) and click the create role button

5. You should see your ecsServiceRole now in the list of roles since you're back to where step 1 lead you (a list of roles)

Let me know how it goes.
