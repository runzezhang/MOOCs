## Udemy
Best and cheap course website for engineer and skill learning. Without too much theory, mainly focus on practise. But keep eye on the comments before you pay the course, some techs update so quick so some of courses are not up-to-date.
- [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
- [Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers](https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/)
- [Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python](https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/)

## Code Cademy
Free course for rookie is good, awsome online code enviornment. But the project for Pro users..emm Not up to expectations, not bad for learning but the paid project may better like a real industry project. Upgrade much seems recently, I never use the Data Science Part, but it maybe a good course to start data science learning as well.
- Introduction to HTML
- Introduction to CSS
- Introduction to SASS
- Introduction to JavaScript
- Introduction to Python2
